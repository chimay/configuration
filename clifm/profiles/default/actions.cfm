# CliFM actions file #

# Define here your custom actions. Actions are custom command names
# binded to a shell script located in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/PROFILE/scripts.
# Actions can be executed directly from CliFM command line, as if they
# were any other command, and the associated script will be executed
# instead. All parameters passed to the action command will be passed
# to the action script as well.
