# \H: The full hostname
# \n: A newline character
# \r: A carriage return
# \a: A bell character

# by CliFM
# \S: The number of the current workspace
# \l: Print an 'L' if running in light mode
# \t: The time, in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
# \T: The time, in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
# \@: The time, in 12-hour am/pm format
# \A: The time, in 24-hour HH:MM format
# \w: The full current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
# \W: The basename of $PWD, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
# \p: A mix of the two above, it abbreviates the current working directory
# only if longer than PathMax (a value defined in the configuration file).
