* Configuration files

A coherent set of configuration files for my favorite apps.


* Keybindings

The keybindings are essentially vim, less or emacs like, depending on
the context. For example :

  - Vim

    + Neomutt index

  - Less

    + Elinks

    + W3m

    + Neomutt pager

    + Newsboat

  - Emacs

    + Zsh

    + Elinks edit mode


** Prefix & Modes

Some applications :

  - Can use an independant keymap introduced by a prefix key

    + tmux

  - Can use independant keymap modes

    + i3, tmux, emacs, vim


** Allocation

The following keys are reserved for Window Manager (i3) :

  - Mod3 (menu key) with any key(s)

  - Mod4 (super key) with

    + Arrows

    + Page Up / Down

    + Home / End

    + F1 .. F12

    + Modifier(s)

  - Mod4 with other modifier(s) and

    + Any key(s)

  - Préfix chosen in the previous keys

  - Sub mode entered with one or more of the previous keys

The following keys are reserved for applications :

  - Mod4 with all other keys :

    + Letters

    + Digits

    + & @ ^ $ ! ( ) [ ] { } ...

  - Préfix chosen in the previous keys

  - Sub mode entered with one or more of the previous keys


** Coherence

To be as intuitive as possible, some conventions are applied :

  - Move focus between X windows :

    + Mod4 + arrows

  - Move focus between tmux panes, vim and emacs windows :

    + Shift + arrows

  - Move focus between buffers :

    + Meta (Alt) + left / right arrows

    + Meta (Alt) + page up / down

  - Move focus between tabs :

    + Ctrl + left / right arrows

    + Ctrl + page up / down


* Warning

I try to be mindful when I code, but some bugs might remain, so be careful.
