* Configuration files

A coherent set of configuration files for my favorite apps.

The keybindings are essentially vim, less or emacs like, depending on
the context. For example :

    + Neomutt index

  - Less

    + Elinks

    + W3m

    + Neomutt pager

    + Newsboat

  - Emacs

    + Zsh

    + Elinks edit mode

Beyond thar, some applications :

  - Can use an independant keymap introduced by a prefix key

    + tmux

  - Can use independant keymap modes

    + i3

Reserved for Window Manager (i3) :

  - Mod3 (menu key) with any other key

  - Mod4 (super key) with

    + Arrows

    + Page Up / Down

    + Home / End

    + Other modifier

  - Préfix chosen in the previous keys

Reserved for applications :

  - Mod 4 with all other keys :

    + Letters

    + Digits

    + & @ ^ $ ! ( ) [ ] { } ...

  - Préfix chosen in the previous keys

* Warning

I try to be mindful when I code, but some bugs might remain, so be careful.
