#@ /etc/mail.rc
#@ Configuration file for Mail v14.9.22.
#@ The syntax of this file is interpreted as follows:
#@ - Any leading and trailing whitespace (space, tabulator, newline: " \t\n"),
#@   and all members of (the internal variable) *ifs-ws* are removed.
#@ - Empty lines are ignored.
#@ - Any other line is a command line.  Such lines may spread over multiple
#@   lines if a reverse solidus character \ is placed as the last character of
#@   all lines except the final one; any leading whitespace of follow lines is
#@   removed, but trailing whitespace before "escaped newlines" is not.
#@ - The number sign # is the comment-command and causes the (joined) line
#@   (content) to be ignored.
#@ S-nail v14.9.22 / 2021-02-24

## Variables

# The standard POSIX 2008/Cor 2-2016 mandates the following initial settings
# which are established independendly from this file:
# [a]   noallnet, noappend, asksub, noaskbcc, noaskcc, noautoprint,
# [b-e] nobang, nocmd, nocrt, nodebug, nodot, escape="~",
# [f-i] noflipr, nofolder, header, nohold, noignore, noignoreeof,
# [j-o] nokeep, nokeepsave, nometoo, nooutfolder,
# [p-r] nopage, prompt="? ", noquiet, norecord,
# [s]   save, nosendwait, noshowto, nosign, noSign,
# [t-z] toplines="5"
#
# Notes:
# - In this implementation:
#   + *sendwait* is set by default (and has extended meaning).
#   + no*onehop* does not exist.
#     (To pass options through to the MTA, either add them after a "--"
#     separator on the command line or set the *mta-arguments* variable.)
# - *hold, *keep*, and *keepsave* are deliberately set below.
# (Keep in SYNC: mx/nail.h:okeys, ./nail.rc, ./nail.1:"Initial settings"!)

# Adjustments of standard imposed default- as well as other settings follow.
# - Some of the latter are not portable and may thus have no effect with
#   other Mail(1) / mailx(1) / mail(1) programs.
# - "wysh" is one of the "Command modifiers" and is not portable: before v15 it
#   changes the syntax of some old-style commands to sh(1)ell style quoting,
#   also see "COMMANDS" -> "Shell-style argument quoting" in the manual.
# - Availability of entries marked [OPTION] is a compile-time decision.

# If threaded mode is activated, automatically collapse thread.
#set autocollapse

# Enter threaded mode automatically.
#set autosort=thread

# Append rather than prepend when writing to mbox automatically.

# variables, e.g., *sendcharsets*).
