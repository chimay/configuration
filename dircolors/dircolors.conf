# Basic {{{1

# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types.
# One can use codes for 256 or more colors supported by modern terminals.
# The default color codes use the capabilities of an 8 color terminal
# with some additional attributes as per the following codes:
#
#   - Background color codes:
#       40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white
#
#   - Text color codes:
#       30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
#
#   - Attribute codes:
#       00=none 01=bold 04=underscore 05=blink 07=reverse 08=concealed
