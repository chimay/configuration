* Themes

Minimalist themes for various apps.

Most are brown foreground on black background, with a few extra colors
for syntax highlighting.


** Terminal

The terminal theme is inspired from [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell][Base16-shell]].

Simply source it in zshrc (or bashrc I guess) to apply color changes.


* Warning

I try to be mindful when I code, but some bugs might remain, so be careful.
