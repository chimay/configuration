# Charlton's RIP, encode, and tag script rc file:
#
# Rename this file to .criprc and put in your home directory...
#
# If any of these are omitted or commented out, the defaults that are
# used can be found set at the beginning of the crip script.


# Default contact information (please put your e-mail address here)
# Example:  contact = nobody@nowhere.com

contact =

# encoders supported are "vorbis" and "flac"

encodeto = vorbis

# Flags for oggenc (Ogg Vorbis encoder) command.  Only used only if
#  $encodeto is set to "vorbis".
# Default is "-q 5" which is generally considered the point at which the
# current vorbis codecs attain transparency to source (according to):
#   http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Ogg_Vorbis
# Make sure you are using the best vorbis codec (read this):
#   http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Recommended_Ogg_Vorbis
# Note that "-q 4" is a quality setting roughly equal to 128kbps (average)
# and that "-q 3" (roughly 110kbps) is better than even 128kbps VBR MP3.
# Hint:  If you'd rather put these flags as a command-line option,
#  use:  -o " -q 5"  (with a space as the first character within the
#  quotes so as to not confuse the command-line parser)

oggencflags = -q 7

# flacflags:  Only used if encodeto is set to "flac".
# Note: if you include --ogg as a flag and encode to an ogg-formatted
# flac file,  crip will try to use metaflac to write the tags and that
# seems to fail.  I'm not sure what the best way to handle this scenario is.
# If anyone out there wants to make flac files within the .ogg framework,
# please enlighten me as to 1) why,  and 2) what is one supposed to use to
# modify comments in this .ogg file,  vorbiscomment?!

flacflags = --best --replay-gain

# Flags for cdparanoia (CD ripper) command.
# I like to use "-v -z" here.
# If you find the "-v" is too verbose and pointless,  feel free to take it
# out.  That would significantly reduce the size of your terminal output.
# I find that using "-z" is good because I like knowing that when the script
# finishes cdparanoia did not encounter anything that could lead to an
# audible defect.  However sometimes the script might hang indefinitely
# because of the "-z".  If you find that is the case,  you can now ctrl-C
# during the rip and set new options (say, to "-v --never-skip=40") so that
# you can at least go back and listen to see if there were any audible
# defects (most of the time there isn't even if the rip wasn't perfect).

cdparanoiaflags = -v -z

# The first comment field in the tag-info will default be:
# "Produced using crip v3.6 (http://bach.dynet.com/crip) on <date/timestamp>"
# (version subject to change accordingly)
# If you want a 2nd comment line in your ogg tag,  uncomment and edit the
# following line:
#comment = <your comment here if you really want>

# Get the title information that goes into the tag either from the
# "filename" or the "cddb" info.
# Default is "filename",  because sometimes the CDDB info is wrong.
# Note that if you set this to "cddb" but there isn't any CDDB info,
# it'll just set it based on the filename anyway.

settitle = filename

# editnames: "off" = Use the legacy command-line to edit filenames;
# "on" = use an editor;  and "both" = use the command-line to edit the
# filenames but also asks afterwards if you want to edit the filenames
# with the editor.   default = "on".

editnames = on

# Your favorite editor for editing filenames and tag files

editor = nvim -u ~/racine/config/edit/neovim/rc-vimzsh.vim

# Normalization is not necessary with replaygain/vorbisgain tags, so
# turn off normalization by default.
# This option can either be "on" or "off".

normalize = off

# Volume threshold - if peak vol > 1/$volthresh don't bother normalizing
# Default is 1.078.  If you set this value real high,  your songs probably
# won't be normalized but you'll still get the "not normalized, peak=X.XXX"
# in your comment (you won't get this in your comment if normalize is off,
# but you'll still have peak and group-peak info in your replaygain (vorbisgain)
# tags,  but these tags are not visible using xmms thru v1.2.7).
# If normalize = "off" then $volthresh is ignored.

volthresh = 1.078

# trimsilence can either be "on" or "off",  depending on whether or not you
#  want to trim silence off the beginning & end of your track/group.
# Note that if you turn both trimsilence and normalize off,  you won't need
#  sox-12.17.0 or wav_find_beginning or wav_find_end.
# I personally always set this to "on",  but I'm defaulting it to "off" so
# that the wav_find_X binaries aren't necessary.  It doesn't seem to make
# much difference in the final file sizes anyway.

trimsilence = off

# trimsilargs are the arguments that sox will take to trim the silence
# from your tracks (if trimsilence is on in the first place).
# A very safe setting is "silence 1 0:0:0.01 -96d"

trimsilargs = silence 1 0:0:0.01 -96d

# (i.e. anything louder than -96db for more than one hundredth of a second
#  will be considered the beginning of the sound.)

# The type of media that the source comes from (default = "CD")
# this just gets put in a comment

sourcemedia = CD

# Default genre:  set to "classical" as default:

#genre = classical

# Default device to rip from

# Classical-style questioning defaults to "off" (because I'm assuming
# most people will be ripping 'pop-style' CDs most of the time),

askclassical = off

# ...unless the genre ends up being "classical", or one of the
# classicalgenres specified inside the crip script, which can only
# be set inside the script itself.

# Skip the album abbreviation question?
# (turn this "on" if you never want to be asked for or have the album
#  abbreviation.  If you rip a bunch of classical CDs and don't want
#  to have to answer null to the album abbreviation question every
#  time it's asked,  but otherwise for non-classical CDs you want to
#  have the album abbreviation,  set to "classical".)
# "off", "on", or "classical" - default should be "classical".

skipalbumabv = off

# Turn this on to skip the ripping process and create empty .wav files.
# By turning this on you will automatically turn on $stopgap so that
# you will have a chance to substitute the empty .wav files with the
# .wav files that you presumably already have.

skiprip = off

# Add a 'stop-gap' for allowing user to edit the .wav files before
# they are encoded?  This is done after the digital silence trimming.

stopgap = off

# Eject CD when done with it.  "off" by default.

ejectcd = off

# Map euro characters in the default filenames to American characters
# (turn "on" if you are an American imperialist)

mapeurochars = off

# Allow spaces in filenames
# I recommend leaving this off because it is bad form to have spaces in
# filenames regardless of whether you are on UNIX or Windows.  I have included
# the option because there are too many Windoze users out there who flooded
# the internet with sorry-ass MP3s made with bad encoders, no tag information,
# and inappropriate file naming conventions, and who are still too used to
# putting spaces in their filenames.  I figure having this feature will
# encourage them to use this script and make better quality files for
# everyone.  (no offense to the person who suggested me this feature)
# So if you absolutely must have spaces in your filenames,  turn
# this to "on" (default is "off").
